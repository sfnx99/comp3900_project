This project focuses on the front-end demonstration of Self Sovereign Identities (SSI). Therefore, the novelty of this project stems from the navigation of the front-end UI to obtain a valid UNSW identity that can be used to authenticate the user's identity in three separate use cases. This includes 

- UNSW exams: Where UNSW examiner can present a QR code for students to scan and verify that they are eligible to sit the exam
- UNSW housing: Where UNSW students can use their SSI to verify that they are a UNSW student and apply for university housing
- UNSW employer: Where UNSW students can apply on the UNSW employability website to become a casual academic

Backend was provided by the capstone-project-3900t11abookworms, which implemented all necessary protocols associated with SSIs.
